# Choir-practice-midi-player
Web-based Midi player specifically targeted to target choir practice. It aims to separate the different midi channels. 
This is achieved by panning the channels and letting the user select instruments from a good quality soundfont for each track. The interface has been designed to be simple, but effective for practice.
The implementation is a front-end to the excellent [spessasynth_lib](https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth).
