# Choir-practice-midi-player
Web-based Midi player specifically targeted to target choir practice. It aims to separate the different midi channels. 
This is achieved by panning the channels and letting the user select instruments from a good quality soundfont for each track. The interface has been designed to be simple, but effective for practice.
The implementation is a front-end to the excellent [spessasynth_lib](https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth).

## Usage
Use this link [https://birkeeper.github.io/Choir-practice-midi-player/midi_player.html](https://birkeeper.github.io/Choir-practice-midi-player/midi_player.html) to start the midi player. It should work in many different browsers on many operating systems, including Android, iOS, Windows and MacOS. You should give your browser "Music and Audio" permissions to let the application function properly. The first time you run it, it takes some time to download the soundfont before you can interact with the application. A Wi-Fi connection is recommended to shorten the waiting time. After that the application will respond quicker, because the soundfont is stored in cache. After the installation, the application can also run offline.
It is possible to install the app to your home screen of your smartphone by using "Add to Home Screen". When you do that, it will behave more like a full screen app.
